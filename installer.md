# Setup installer

You need a real Mac to create a bootable macOS installer, if you don't have it then you can create a VM by [this way](https://techsviewer.com/install-macos-high-sierra-vmware-windows/)

To setup a bootable macOS installer, please download macOS on App Store and follow [this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372) from Apple

If you can't download fully installer from App Store, download full installer from [here](https://sydarchive.com/macos/) (note: you can't unzip it on Windows)

After that, you have to [setup Clover Bootloader](clover.md) to boot into macOS with your PC
